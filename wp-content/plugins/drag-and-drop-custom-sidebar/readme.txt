== Description ==

= The REAL Dynamic Wordpress Sidebar - Basic Version =
The REAL Dynamic WordPress Sidebar abbreviated RDWS solves one major sidebar problem. See it like this.

*  On Page 1 your content is 2500 px height 
* On Page 2 your Content is 750 px height
*  And your Sidebar is 1250 px height 
In this scenario your page is always out of balance because either the Sidebar is to height or the content is to short.  
By wrapping content in an extruder we can solve this problem

= The REAL Dynamic Wordpress Sidebar - Pro Version =
To improve the relevance of your content it is a good thing to show different elements on the sidebars for some posts or pages. Current themes give you some areas to publish the widgets, but those areas are static because they show later on the same content in all posts and pages within the template. 
RDWS allows you to create as many widget areas as you need. By this you can create your own custom sidebars, adding widgets and manage the place in which pages or post they should take place. Further more you can manage the style by setting your own CSS values over a GUI. With RDWS you can create complex websites, with height relevant content, without writing a single line of code.
